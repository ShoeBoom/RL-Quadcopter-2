For each timestep of the agent, we step the simulation `action_repeats` timesteps.  If you are not familiar with action repeats, please read the **Results** section in [the DDPG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).\n","- We set the number of elements in the state vector.  For the sample task, we only work with the 6-dimensional pose information.  To set the size of the state (`state_size`), we must take action repeats into account.  \n","- The environment will always have a 4-dimensional action space, with one entry for each rotor (`action_size=4`). You can set the minimum (`action_low`) and maximum (`action_high`) values of each entry here.\n","- The sample task in this provided file is for the agent to reach a target position.  We specify that target position as a variable.\n","\n","The `reset()` method resets the simulator.  The agent should call this method every time the episode ends.  You can see an example of this in the code cell below.\n","\n","The `step()` method is perhaps the most important.  It accepts the agent's choice of action `rotor_speeds`, which is used to prepare the next state to pass on to the agent.  Then, the reward is computed from `get_reward()`.
